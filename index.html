    <p class="section-two__desc">Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length:<br> a paragraph
        is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc.<br> In reality, though, the unity
        and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.<br> A paragraph is defined as “a group
        of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116).<br> Length and appearance do
        not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. <br>For instance, in some styles of writing,
        particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.<br> Ultimately, a paragraph is a
        sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea.<br> In this handout, we will refer to this as the
        “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.</p>
