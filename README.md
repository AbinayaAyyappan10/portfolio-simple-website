# portfolio-simple-website
This is a personal portfolio website created using HTML and CSS. It showcases my basic web development skills and includes two main pages:

Home Page – A brief introduction about me.

Contact Page – A simple form for visitors to reach out.

The project is fully responsive and designed with a clean, minimalist layout to ensure easy navigation and readability.
